<p>Actions modules which distort the presentation space to
support enhanced navigation and browsing. Most distortion techniques magnify a
"focal" region of space, allocating more screen space and showing items in
higher detail. Non-focal space is compressed/demagnified, but remains visible
to keep everything in context.</p>

higher detail. Non-focal space is compressed/demagnified, but remains visible
to keep everything in context.
